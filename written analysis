You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

1.	The temperature gets higher as you get closer to 0 degrees latitude or the equator. Temperature gets lower as you get farther away from 0 or the poles. 
2.	The northern hemisphere is warmer and experiences more humidity than the southern hemisphere. Speculating the northern hemisphere is more industrious and populated than the southern hemisphere so this difference in temperature and humidity could be the result of more greenhouse gasses being produced in that region. 
3.	Wind speeds tend to be highest away from the equator but are mainly centralized between 5-10mph.
